## Realtime Network Threat Detection using OSINT and ML

This repository implements a system for real-time network threat detection by combining Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. 

### Project Goals

* Leverage OSINT sources to enrich network data with threat intelligence.
* Train a machine learning model to identify suspicious network activity in real-time.
* Provide early warnings and improve overall network security posture.

### Features

* Integrates with network traffic capture tools (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump)
* Fetches threat intelligence from public OSINT sources (e.g., threat feeds, malicious domain lists)
* Preprocesses network data and enriches it with OSINT findings
* Trains and utilizes an ML model for real-time threat detection
* Alerts on potential threats based on model predictions

### Dependencies

This project requires several libraries to be installed. You can find them listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Use the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Configure OSINT Sources:**
    * Update the configuration file (`config.py`) to specify the desired OSINT sources and their access credentials (if applicable).

2. **Start the System:**
    * Run the main script (`main.py`) to initiate data capture, processing, and threat detection.

**Note:** This is a basic outline. The specific implementation details might vary depending on your chosen tools and libraries.
